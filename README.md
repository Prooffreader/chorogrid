There are two classes, Chorobin to assign colors to quantities, and Chorogrid to make the maps.

Maps are made in SVG format; if you need to convert them to PNG you can do so in an external application like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator, or in python with CairoSVG among other solutions.

Pro tip: it's "choropleth", not "chloropleth"; there's no L. The word comes from ancient Greek χώρα (khṓra, “location”) and πλῆθος (plêthos, “a great number”, same root as *plethora*), not χλωρός (khlōrós, “pale green”) as in *chlorine* and *chlorophyll*. Luckily Google knows the difference.
